# Data Manipulation and Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview
The "Data Manipulation and Statistical Analysis" project focuses on transforming and analyzing data using R. This project is documented in an R Markdown file (`Data Manipulation_Statistical Analysis.Rmd`) and includes comprehensive data manipulation techniques along with statistical analyses to derive insights from the data.

## Data Source
The datasets used in this project are sourced from publicly available data repositories. Specific details about the datasets, including their sources, are referenced within the R Markdown file.

- **Primary Data Source**: 
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Data Manipulation_Statistical Analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the code, data manipulation techniques, and statistical analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset(s) used in the project.
- `output/`: Folder for any outputs generated by the R Markdown file, such as cleaned data, plots, or statistical summaries.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Summary
This project demonstrates the use of R for data manipulation and statistical analysis. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and various statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling. The results are visualized and interpreted within the R Markdown document.

## Installation and Usage
To work with this project, you need R and RStudio installed on your machine. The following R packages are necessary:

- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `readr`
- `stats`

### Steps to Run:
1. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Run the code chunks sequentially to perform the data manipulation and statistical analysis.
3. Use the "Knit" function to generate a report in HTML, PDF, or Word format that documents the analysis and results.
